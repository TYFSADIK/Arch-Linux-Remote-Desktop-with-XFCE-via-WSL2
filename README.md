# Arch-Linux-Remote-Desktop-with-XFCE-via-WSL2
I hate carrying my beast laptop that's why I build it. Now I can use it from anywhere in this world. I just need a single device and I can access my any distro and any operating system without changing router port forwarding.  

# üñ•Ô∏è Arch Linux Remote Desktop (XFCE) via noVNC + ngrok

This guide walks you through setting up an XFCE desktop environment on Arch Linux that you can access **from anywhere using a browser**, securely tunneled with `ngrok`. It includes VNC, noVNC, system packages, and ngrok configuration.

---

## ‚úÖ What You'll Achieve

- Headless Arch Linux XFCE desktop
- Remote desktop in your browser via noVNC
- Public access using ngrok tunnel (secure, token-authenticated)

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Arch Linux (VM or bare metal)
- Internet connection
- A [free ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Install XFCE + VNC + Required Packages
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S tigervnc xfce4 xfce4-goodies xorg-xinit dbus unzip
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to select packages for `xfce4` ‚Äî press Enter to select all.

---

## üß† 2. Configure VNC Startup for XFCE

Create `~/.vnc/xstartup`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vnc
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
```
Paste this:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
exec startxfce4
```
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

---

## üöÄ 3. Start VNC Server
```bash
vncserver :1
```
This will launch a VNC session at `localhost:5901`.

To stop:
```bash
vncserver -kill :1
```

---

## üåê 4. Download and Set Up noVNC
```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/novnc/noVNC.git
cd noVNC
sudo git clone https://github.com/novnc/websockify.git
```

---

## üîó 5. Start noVNC WebSocket Proxy
```bash
cd /opt/noVNC
./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5901
```

You can now access your desktop at:  
**http://localhost:6080**

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 6. Install ngrok

```bash
cd /opt
curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/
```

Then authenticate:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <your-token>
```

---

## üåç 7. Expose noVNC with ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 6080
```
You‚Äôll get a public HTTPS URL like:
```
Forwarding https://something.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:6080
```
Use this in any browser to access your remote XFCE desktop.

---

## üîí Bonus: Security Best Practices

- Always kill VNC with `vncserver -kill :1` when not in use.
- Add basic authentication with ngrok config file (`~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`).
- Don‚Äôt expose this long term. Use firewall + random passwords if needed.

---

##  Suggested

- XFCE desktop via browser
- Terminal showing `vncserver :1`
- Terminal showing `ngrok http 6080`
- noVNC interface loaded in browser

---

## üßæ .gitignore Example
```
*.log
.vnc/*.pid
.vnc/*.log
*.zip
*.tar.gz
```

---

## üì¶ GitHub Push Example
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/arch-remote-xfce.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Remote XFCE via noVNC"
git push -u origin master
```
